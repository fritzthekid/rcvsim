# rcvsim

**!!! The project is currently empty and it will take a lot of time to get some basic results. !!!**

A simple trial to simulate RISC-V architecture. The architecture is based on

[Custom RISC-V Processor Built In VHDL](https://hackaday.com/2021/08/03/custom-risc-v-processor-built-in-vhdl/)

[stnolting (Frauenhofer-IMS): The NEORV32 RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32)
